Hello,

I have decided to continue writing in English instead on [Lithuanian](http://old.lescinskas.lt).

I have also switched from custom made CMS for writing blog to static site generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which lets focusing on writing content and not to care that much about the platform maintenance. Also, as all content is file-based, for technical person it is more fun to create, manage, version, build and deploy the blog. I promise to write a post about it.

Also, I have translated some posts from my Lithuanian blog, that might be stil relevant: [GNU screen]({%post_url /2011/2011-04-05-gnu-screen %}), [Internationalization (i18n) in PHP]({% post_url /2013/2013-08-16-internationalization-in-php %}), [Installing Sphinx search with Lithuanian stemmer]({% post_url /2013/2013-08-21-sphinx-with-lithuanian-stemmer %}).

If you have been reading my blog previously via any RSS reader, please update the link to the feed.

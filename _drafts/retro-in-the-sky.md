Yup, that's literally what it sounds like. Retro 326m above the ground in [Vilnius TV tower].

Me and my team have been working on a cross-team project for a quite long period of time (half year). Although the whole project is not finished yet, we have completed one big epic, and decided to celebrate it and also have a reflective session (retrospective) what's been done, what we succeeded and what not.

## Retro goals

I've had the following goals for this retrospective:

### Learn new retro techniques

I am very lucky that my team members are self-organizing and can constructively evaluate the status and progress of the team. Therefore the very basic retrospective format (what's good; what's to be improved; actions) still works for us.

However I wanted to try the format and activities suggested in the [Agile Retrospectives] book. There's also a very neat tool [Retromat] that can help in making the desirable retrospective agenda.

### Review what we have done during last months

Big projects, or product epics that last for multiple months are tend to be forgotten. Especially smaller parts of it. Therefore I wanted my team to remember and review the things we have done during last half-year. This can be the foundation of the further discussion and can also help the team understand its capacity and velocity better.

### Celebrate the completion of an epic

I absolutely agree with the idea to [Celebrate small victories]. But when it happens to work on a product/project/task for a longer period of time, it also gives the time to try various ideas, validate the assumptions and have the results. Also, some problems become visible only when you look at them from the bigger perspective.
Therefore a retrospective of the longer timeframe is also beneficial. Also, it's a good time to gather with the team and spend some time together.

### Improve the execution of further big cross-team projects

Definitely, generating insights and agreeing on the particular actions are the mandatory parts of the retrospective. 

## Retro plan

### Set the stage

During this stage I asked every team member to tell his expectations for this retrospective and I stated why in my opinion we need this event.

### Gather the data

As one of my goals was to review what's been done during past half year, I asked my teammates to draw a timeline and define what was done during particular time.
It was fun to compare the results with the real facts.
Also it was a good start for the further discussions which led to generating insights and declaring actions.

### Generate insights

### Decide what to do

### Close the retro

## Findings

 * Cross-team dependencies should be clear and transparent
 * Such project must have project manager and followed all management activities (planning, stakeholder management etc.)
 * There must be an integration plan
 * Everything should be written down
 * Iterative approach should be followed, trade-offs should be made
 * There should be a plan how to collect feedback
 * Backlog refinement (grooming) activities should include old stories

Let's have a quick summary of each of those todo's.

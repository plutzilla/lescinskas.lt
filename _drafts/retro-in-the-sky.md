Yup, that's literally what it sounds like. Retro 326m above the ground.

Me and my team have been working on a cross-team project. 

## Retro goals

### Learn new retro techniques

### Review what we have done during last months

### Celebrate the completion of an epic

### Improve the execution of further big cross-team projects

## Retro plan

### Learn new retro techniques

### Review what we have done during last months

### Celebrate the completion of an epic

### Improve the execution of further big cross-team projects

## Findings

 * Cross-team dependencies should be clear and transparent
 * Such project must have project manager and followed all management activities (planning, stakeholder management etc.)
 * There must be an integration plan
 * Everything should be written down
 * Iterative approach should be followed, trade-offs should be made
 * There should be a plan how to collect feedback
 * Backlog refinement (grooming) activities should include old stories

Let's have a quick summary of each of those todo's.

Good:

 * Google Maps with Traffic data
 * Modern infotainment experience
 * Auto 2.0 has phone-only mode. Bluetooth is enough to use Auto.
 * Voice messaging and commands (only in English)
 * Possibly bright future with more apps/integrations
 * Control volume, switch songs on the driving wheel

Bad:

 * Voice control is not accurate, especially for non-English content
 * Not available in many countries
 * Always using ambient sensor (v1)
 * Limited scrolling capabilities and control when driving. Doesn't make sense if a passenger controls the unit
 * Requires cabling
 * Poor car infotainment system resolution (800x480). It's not even announced
 * No text messaging
 * Navigation info is displayed in the infotainment system, but not in the dash

Verdict: if you have a BT, better buy a car phone holder

When I was looking for a new car, one of my requirements for the car was to have the Android Auto support.
I expected a lot from this system, and the manufacturers who invest into supporting new technologies, get kudos from me.

I have chosen Škoda Octavia, however I had to pay additional 150 € for Android Auto support.

Here is my experience after using Android Auto for some time using it.

## Availability

At the time I bought this car, Android Auto was not available in Lithuania (the country where I live).
So it was a disappointing moment to discover that you can't use what you've paid for.

Luckily, it is possible to sideload the APK file from the [mirror site](http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/android-auto/).
You lose the automatic updates and security assurance, but it's still better than nothing.

## What's inside

### Environment

The built-in infotainment system I bought with my car is 6,5" "Columbus".

I must say that this system is very good: it has very precise offline Navigation (probably, with "here" maps) with 3 years update support,
FM radio with RDS, media support from Bluetooth, aux-in, USB, SD card sources.

The Bluetooth integration pairs the phone automatically, synchronizes contacts, calls, SMS messages,
allows to control calls and music playback via controls on the steering wheel.

As one of the goals of developing Android Auto was to replace the ugly and uncomfortable built-in infotainment systems,
competition with VW-designed infotainment system is the challenging task.

The infotainment system screen resolution is only 800x480, which is far behind even my Full HD smartphone,
also limiting the possibilities of Android auto.


### Navigation

Android Auto uses Google Maps navigation. Rumors say that there should be the support for other navigation systems soon,
but Google Maps is pretty good.

Probably the biggest advantage of the offline navigation systems is that Google Maps use realtime traffic information
for route planning.



> Due to the Android Auto safety requirements, it is not allowed to make more than 6 touch interactions with the system
when the car is moving. You must use voice control for everything.

### Phone and messaging

### Music

### Voice control

### Android Auto 2.0

### Automate

### Limitations (???)


## Verdict



Good:

 * Google Maps with Traffic data
 * Modern infotainment experience
 * Auto 2.0 has phone-only mode. Bluetooth is enough to use Auto.
 * Voice messaging and commands (only in English)
 * Possibly bright future with more apps/integrations
 * Control volume, switch songs on the driving wheel

Bad:

 * Voice control is not accurate, especially for non-English content
 * Not available in many countries
 * Always using ambient sensor (v1)
 * Limited scrolling capabilities and control when driving. Doesn't make sense if a passenger controls the unit
 * Requires cabling
 * Poor car infotainment system resolution (800x480). It's not even announced
 * No text messaging
 * Navigation info is displayed in the infotainment system, but not in the dash

Verdict: if you have a BT, better buy a car phone holder
